2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.026 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/speed_counter_reg[24]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.026 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/speed_counter_reg[25]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.026 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/speed_counter_reg[26]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/y2_reg[0]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/y2_reg[1]/R (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/y2_reg[2]/S (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/y2_reg[3]/S (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/y2_reg[8]/S (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#9 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between pg/bpm_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and pg/notegen/y2_reg[9]/S (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
